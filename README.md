# File System using Node js

This project provides a simple file management system using Node.js and Express.js, file system. It includes two main API endpoints for creating a file with the current timestamp and retrieving all files in a specified folder. The folder location is configurable via environment variables. And used moment.js for handling the current date and time stamps.

**All the APIs are well documented using Postman Documentation and Published** - [published API documentation link](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/34880470/2sA3dxEByh)



**Note: Since I'm deployed the apis in render's free tier, The initial request is taking time, Please wait little longer for initial request**
